General points:
- Verify input (K, max_iter are positive ints / input, output are .txt files)
- Generalize as much as possible (make K, epsilon and max_iter optional)
- Format to only 4 digits after the dot

C points:
- Return value is 0 if successful, 1 otherwise
- Free allocated memory
- Use double
