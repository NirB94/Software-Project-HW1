General points:
- Verify input (max iter is positive integer, K is an integer between 1 and N not inclusive)
- Generalize as much as possible (make K, epsilon and max_iter optional)
- Format to only 4 digits after the dot

C points:
- Return value is 0 if successful, 1 otherwise
- Free allocated memory
- Use double

Python points:
- Use float
