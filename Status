General points:
- Verify input (max iter is positive integer, K is an integer between 1 and N not inclusive)
- Generalize as much as possible (make K, epsilon and max_iter optional)
- Format to only 4 digits after the dot

C points:
- Return value is 0 if successful, 1 otherwise
- Free allocated memory
- Use double
- Comment about find_norm actually calculating the norm squared

Python points:
- Think about switching centroid rep. from tuple to list
- Think about spliting finding closet centroid to a helper function
- Comment about find_norm actually calculating the norm squared
